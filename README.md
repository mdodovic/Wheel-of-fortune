# Wheel-of-fortune
Wheel of fortune is html page that randomly choose one question from the list of questions and show it.

Questions are numerated and they are not presented directly on the wheel. Instead of questions' text, there are numbers from 1 to number of questions.
Every question is marked by number and unique color.
After some question has been chosen, it cannot be chosen again and it is marked black.
